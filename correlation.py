    The original formulation from Milne et al. expresses the relative weighting
    of linear (relevance) and quadratic (redundancy) coefficients through a
    parameter alpha.  However, this parameter does not adjust for the fact that
    the total number of quadratic terms depends on the number of features in the
    solution.

    We define a new parameter, beta, which adjusts for the relative number of
    linear and quadratic terms.  Let the objective function be expressed as:

    $$\beta \sum linear + (1 - \beta) / (2 (k - 1)) \sum quad$$

    where $k$ is the number of features in the solution, and the $2*(k-1)$
    factor corrects for the relative number of terms in each sum (the factor of
    2 is because the Milne et al. formulation counts each unique redundancy term
    twice).

    The conversion between alpha and beta is obtained by equating the ratio of
    linear to quadratic weighting coefficients in each formulation.

    Args:
        beta (float): Weighting parameter between 0 and 1.
        k (int): Number of features in the solution.
